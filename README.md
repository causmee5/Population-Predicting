# COMP3006FinalProject
Final Project Work for DU COMP3006
This project uses population data sets obtained from the US Census Bureau. The data sets are state population data
and county population data. The objective of this project is to predict population increases and decreases for each
state and county for the year 2010. Projections will be made using 1990 and 2000 data and will then be compared to
the actual census data of 2010.
